This is a modification of the original synthetic generator from the 
IBM Almaden group. The original version can be downloaded from 
http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/syndata.html

We have only made minor changes in order to compile the code using the 
GNU g++ complier. Comments in the code are highlighted by "// g++" comments.

For documentation on this program, you can refer to the IBM site. 

To compile this version, simply type "make"

We have added a simple script (run) to drive the execution, and 
to handle the parameters accepted by "gen". 

For any problem about this porting, you can contact
